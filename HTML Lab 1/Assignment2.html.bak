	<p>I love the aviation program here at UND! I find it incredible how we have such a large
fleet of aircrafts at our disposel in order to fly as much as we can as a school. In 2020, students in 
UND's flight training programs broke a record for hours flown at 126,000. The school made getting my
 private pilot license a great experience that was far from easy, but a lot of fun, they teach the 
 fundamental basics as well as everything else it takes to be a pilot.</p>
<p>The curriculum at UND is designed to prepare the student for any flight-related career path.
By earning ratings such as instrument, commercial and multi-engine as well as becoming a CFI allows us as
students to be fully educated while building hours towards becoming an airline pilot. Becoming a CFI and
teaching the new pilots within the same program is an effecient ecosystem as well as gives the CFI's the
opportunity to master their knowledge by teaching it to someone else.</p>
