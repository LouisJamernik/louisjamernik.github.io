	<h2><center>UND Men's Hockey Team</center></h2>
	<p>I have the honour of playing for one of the best hockey programs in the country, but 
	with that comes an extremely demanding schedule. I am at the rink every morning from 6:30am to 12pm 
	on the weekdays and every weekend we play two games either at home or on the road. I was fortunate 
	enough to be recruited to UND from the Okotoks Oilers of the the Alberta Junior Hockey League in December
	of 2019. I was initially penciled in to arrive on campus for the fall of '21, but due to injury and a lot
	of uncertainty around COVID, the coaching staff decided to call me up a semester early so I was fortunate
	enough to start my NCAA career last Spring of '21. This experience has not only given me an advantage of
	getting to know our structure and systems better, but it has also allowed me to earn the coaches trust sooner
	rather than being brand new to the culture this past fall. I'm incredibly greatful for how well we get treated
	here at the school and what an amazing program we have here to allow us as hockey players to develop every single
	day.</p>
